# This is our shitty repository for renpy/py code. There wont be TOO much to do round these parts, but there are some streamiling issues that need to be adressed. The first of these issues is a smart parser, that can parse dialogue statements for certain tags, and perform some audio/visual/etc happening or function when such a tag is encountered. This greatly reduces statement redundancy (You'll see what I mean in the first version of script.rpy) and makes the piece (from a dialogue perspective) far more readable. As of now ive got the framework for the parser done, all that it needs now is some neato features, which are easy to add. Its far from optimized but it'll do LUL
